    <h1>Cybersecurity Threats & Protection</h1>
    <p>As digital transformation accelerates, cybersecurity becomes a top concern for individuals and organizations. Threats like phishing, ransomware, zero-day exploits, and data breaches are becoming more sophisticated, targeting both technical vulnerabilities and human behavior.</p>

    <p>Organizations must implement multi-layered security strategies that include strong authentication, regular patching, employee awareness training, and real-time monitoring. Security frameworks like Zero Trust and best practices such as the Principle of Least Privilege can significantly reduce risk.</p>

    <p>In addition to technical controls, compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO standards is essential. Ultimately, cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and proactive defense is the best form of protection.</p>
