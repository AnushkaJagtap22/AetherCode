    <h1>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most transformative forces in the 21st century. From personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars and intelligent healthcare diagnostics, AI is reshaping our world. As computational power increases and data becomes more abundant, AI systems continue to learn, adapt, and improve at unprecedented rates.</p>

    <p>Industries across the board—from finance and retail to manufacturing and education—are integrating AI to automate processes, enhance decision-making, and deliver better user experiences. However, with great power comes great responsibility. Ethical concerns such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and job displacement remain critical issues that researchers and policymakers must address.</p>

    <p>As we navigate the AI-driven future, the focus must shift toward building transparent, fair, and accountable systems. With proper regulation and public awareness, the rise of AI can be a catalyst for progress and equity across societies.</p>
