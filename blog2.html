    <h1>Introduction to Quantum Computing</h1>
    <p>Quantum computing represents a new paradigm of computation that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers, which use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously (superposition). This unique ability allows quantum systems to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical counterparts.</p>

    <p>Key components of quantum computing include superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates. These concepts may seem abstract but are the foundation of building quantum algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm for factorization or Grover’s algorithm for database search.</p>

    <p>While quantum computers are still in their early stages, tech giants and research institutions are making rapid progress. Challenges remain in error correction, stability, and scalability. Nonetheless, quantum computing holds immense promise in fields such as cryptography, materials science, and artificial intelligence.</p>
