    <h1>Why Learn Data Structures & Algorithms?</h1>
    <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are foundational concepts in computer science. Mastery of DSA helps developers write efficient, optimized code that performs well under various constraints. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or building real-world applications, DSA skills are crucial.</p>

    <p>Data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs help organize and store data efficiently. Algorithms such as sorting, searching, recursion, and dynamic programming solve common computational problems in optimal time.</p>

    <p>Practicing DSA not only improves your problem-solving skills but also enhances your logical thinking and coding fluency. Investing time in DSA is one of the best decisions for a successful tech career.</p>
