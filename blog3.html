    <h1>Web Development in 2025</h1>
    <p>Web development is evolving rapidly, and by 2025, we are likely to see more automation, AI-driven tools, and immersive technologies. Low-code and no-code platforms are making it easier for non-developers to build sophisticated web apps. Meanwhile, web developers are focusing more on design systems, accessibility, and progressive web apps (PWAs).</p>

    <p>Frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte are pushing the boundaries of frontend development, while backend is becoming serverless and cloud-native. The adoption of WebAssembly, GraphQL, and edge computing are also changing how web applications are structured and delivered to users.</p>

    <p>As user expectations rise, performance, security, and personalization will remain key focus areas. Developers in 2025 will need to stay adaptive and embrace lifelong learning to keep up with the pace of innovation.</p>
